It can take much computing power to train a neural network for a large image dataset. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other tech companies have utilized GPU arrays for training high-quality neural networks for various applications. Transferring these weights into your neural network can save you considerable effort and compute time. It is unlikely that a pretrained model will exactly fit the application that you seek to implement. Finding the closest pretrained model and using transfer learning is essential for a deep learning engineer.
